# 1. Feedback
	# A total of 8 feedbacks were received from your learners. 
	#  The major issue with the low rating is the learners were not able to hear you in the session properly. 
	#the session's topic was different from the topic's mentioned in the agenda. 
	# There was no discussion on real world business phenomenon, nothing covered on hypothesis and no discussions on inferential stats and its applications.

# 2. Probability
	# Bayes Theorem
	# Sentiment Analysis


# Probability of A and B will die within a year is p and q. What is the probability that only one of them will alive at the end of the year.


# Probabilty that a person will hit a target is 0.3. He shoots 10 times. What is the probability, he hits the target?

# A box contains N coins, m of which are fair and rest are biased. 
# The probability of getting head of biased coin is 2/3. A coin is drawn from the box at random and tossed once. It is head. 
 #What is the probaility it is biased.

# F => coin is fair    F` => coin is biased => P(F) = m/N  P(F')= (N-m)/N
# P( H | F') = 2/3  P(H' | F') = 1/3 ; P(H | F) = P(H' | F) = 1/2

# P (F'| H)= 

# P( F` | H ) * P(H) = P( H | F') * P(F') = P ( H & F')
# P(F' | H ) =[ (2/3)*(N-m)/ N ] / [ P(H) = P(F) * P( H | F) + P(F')* P(H| F')]

# D = Man is Defulter
# A = Man age > 50
# I = Income < 10000

# Training  :  P ( A  | D)
# Testing : P ( D | A ) 
           # P( D | I)
			
			#P(D) = P( D | A ) * P(D | I) * P( D | F1)




A = [ 1 2 2
      2 5 4
	  3 8 6]

det ( A ) = 0 



# Average accuracy = 58%    Std = 4%    Sample Size = 10

# You are 99% confident weight = 58 +/-  3*4 /sqrt(10) = 53 - 47

# First time it shows head and second time tail. What is the probability the coin is fair.
